# NEXT AISLE

Web application developed using PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js (PERN) that acts as a simple grocery list application. The application leverages a public API to get aisle information for common grocery items, grouping items together to make the shopping experience easier. Future features will allow the user to create lists for each store they commonly shop at, define the aisle layout of those stores to further sort their list(s), and get suggestions based on their past grocery purchase history.
